Hello! I’m Ahmad Ahmadifar. If you’d like to know more about me, please visit: [https://github.com/ITahmadifar](https://github.com/ITahmadifar "https://github.com/ITahmadifar")

**Now, regarding this repository:**

As you can see, this repository contains three main folders. Each folder includes files related to the courses I took to learn Python, Data Science, and Machine Learning. I’ll attach the certificates for participating in these courses at the end of this message.

**About each Folder:**

1. **Data Mining & ML Project - Predicting Heart Diseases:**
This folder contains my final project, which I completed to demonstrate the knowledge I acquired during the course. In this project, I focused on predicting heart diseases using collected data through data mining and machine learning techniques.

2. **Course Exercises:**
This folder includes exercises that I completed and submitted as assignments after each session of the course.

3. **Course Educational Files:**
The files in this folder are not my personal Python files; rather, they are materials I learned during the course. I included them in this repository to show readers the topics I covered during the course.

**Course certificates:**
